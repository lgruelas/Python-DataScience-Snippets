# PyStatsLearn

I decided to make a package to store the usefull functions for data science models, with the same idea of maintain the source code as clear and simple as possible.

Here will be only simple math functions like _sigmoid funtion_, statistic functions like _mean_, _average_ and so on. More sophisticated things will be in auxiliar files inside each algorithm.
