# Python Snippets for Machine Learning and Statistics algorithms

Python snippets for Machine Learning, Statistics and in general Data Science methods. I will avoid, as far as I can, the use of libraries like spicy, sklearn, etc. The porpouse of this repository is to give a easy to understand resource for algorithms implementations, using only numpy and pandas to manage the data and an implementation from scratch.

With this said, I want to clarify that the use of these codes is not convinient in a real world problem (for that already exist tons of wonderfull libraries), I only reccomend it to studie porpouses. 

I have done this to my better understanding, but I made it public in case that these code could help someone else to understand an algorithm.
